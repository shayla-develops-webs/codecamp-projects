      <h1> Chocolate Blossom Cookies</h1>
      <p>Blossom Cookies are classically a cookie with a Hershey Kiss placed on top of the cookie right as they come out of the oven. There are many variations on the Blossom Cookie, like my Chocolate Peppermint Blossom Cookie or the classic Peanut Butter Kiss Cookies.</p> 

      <p>This Chocolate Blossom Cookie is one of my favorite versions. A delicious, soft and chewy chocolate cookie with a Hershey kiss in the middle makes for a delicious Valentine’s day cookie to add to your holiday party or present to a loved one, but chocolate is a timeless classic that tastes great throughout the year.</p>

        <h1>Top 3 Websites for Coding Challenges</h1>
        <p>If you’re learning to code or prepping for a tech interview, practicing with coding challenges is one of the best ways to sharpen your skills. With so many platforms out there, it can be overwhelming to choose where to start. But three stand out above the rest—LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeWars—each offering a unique approach to problem-solving and skill development.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>LeetCode</h2>
            <p>LeetCode is widely known as the go-to platform for software engineering interview prep. It offers a massive library of problems focused on algorithms, data structures, and technical concepts you’ll see in real-world coding interviews. You can sort problems by difficulty, topic, or even by company (like Google, Amazon, or Meta), making it a highly strategic tool if you're aiming for a developer role. LeetCode also includes a vibrant discussion section where users explain their solutions in depth, helping you not just solve problems but truly understand them.</p>

        <h2>HackerRank</h2>
        <p>HackerRank is a beginner-friendly platform that blends tutorials with coding challenges. It's ideal for those who want a more guided experience, offering full tracks in problem-solving, data structures, and specific programming languages like JavaScript and Python. HackerRank also offers certificates you can share on your resume or LinkedIn profile to showcase your growing skill set. Many companies even use HackerRank as part of their hiring process, so getting comfortable here can give you an extra edge.</p>

        <h2>CodeWars</h2>
        <p>CodeWars takes a more gamified approach to coding. It challenges users with “kata” — short programming puzzles ranked by difficulty — and lets you level up as you progress. What makes CodeWars special is the creative nature of its problems and its focus on writing clean, elegant code. It’s a great way to build daily coding habits and stretch your brain with clever challenges that often feel like logic games.</p>

[00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:06.30] for any YouTube video you can download a
[00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:09.27] written transcript or the subtitles of
[00:00:06.30 --> 00:00:11.49] the video this is especially useful for
[00:00:09.27 --> 00:00:14.37] example if you want to study what
[00:00:11.49 --> 00:00:17.40] someone is saying or you want to edit
[00:00:14.37 --> 00:00:19.89] your own video into a blog post so let
[00:00:17.40 --> 00:00:22.56] me show you an example using one of my
[00:00:19.89 --> 00:00:24.75] own videos and here it is I just
[00:00:22.56 --> 00:00:26.67] uploaded this video a few hours ago and
[00:00:24.75 --> 00:00:29.04] the transcript is already available
[00:00:26.67 --> 00:00:31.62] it only takes YouTube a few hours to
[00:00:29.04 --> 00:00:33.69] have their artificial intelligence sense
[00:00:31.62 --> 00:00:36.78] into what the person is saying and
[00:00:33.69 --> 00:00:39.02] create a transcript so when you go to
[00:00:36.78 --> 00:00:41.91] any youtube video scroll down and
[00:00:39.02 --> 00:00:43.80] underneath the video by the way I'm
[00:00:41.91 --> 00:00:46.71] assuming you are using a laptop or a
[00:00:43.80 --> 00:00:48.36] desktop computer do this scroll down and
[00:00:46.71 --> 00:00:50.43] then click the three dots underneath the
[00:00:48.36 --> 00:00:53.67] video three dots there and then click on
[00:00:50.43 --> 00:00:57.27] open transcript alright so here's what
[00:00:53.67 --> 00:01:00.27] you do you're gonna have to it's if you
[00:00:57.27 --> 00:01:03.81] want to for example edit this into a
[00:01:00.27 --> 00:01:05.70] blog post you want to toggle so that the
[00:01:03.81 --> 00:01:07.26] timestamps are no longer there and you
[00:01:05.70 --> 00:01:09.42] do this by clicking the three dots here
[00:01:07.26 --> 00:01:10.92] once you've opened the transcript click
[00:01:09.42 --> 00:01:12.54] on the three dots here inside the
[00:01:10.92 --> 00:01:15.21] transcript and click on toggle
[00:01:12.54 --> 00:01:16.98] timestamps alright now that the
[00:01:15.21 --> 00:01:18.24] timestamps are gone what I'd like to do
[00:01:16.98 --> 00:01:20.61] is I'd like to scroll down to the very
[00:01:18.24 --> 00:01:24.06] bottom so quickly scroll down to the
[00:01:20.61 --> 00:01:25.02] very bottom and then once I'm at the
[00:01:24.06 --> 00:01:29.03] very bottom whoops
[00:01:25.02 --> 00:01:32.28] the very bottom here I click and select
[00:01:29.03 --> 00:01:38.70] going upwards I find that this is easier
[00:01:32.28 --> 00:01:40.26] and has fewer sort of Mouse errors if I
[00:01:38.70 --> 00:01:42.51] do it from the bottom up instead of from
[00:01:40.26 --> 00:01:46.35] the top down you can experiment yourself
[00:01:42.51 --> 00:01:49.59] but anyway try that and once you have
[00:01:46.35 --> 00:01:53.61] selected it what you need to do then is
[00:01:49.59 --> 00:01:55.92] to do command C on your keyboard if
[00:01:53.61 --> 00:01:58.59] you're on a Mac or on Windows its ctrl C
[00:01:55.92 --> 00:02:01.77] to copy it to your invisible clipboard
[00:01:58.59 --> 00:02:03.57] and then open up a new tab and what I
[00:02:01.77 --> 00:02:07.20] like to do is use Google Docs so I'm
[00:02:03.57 --> 00:02:09.57] gonna type in doc dot new and in case
[00:02:07.20 --> 00:02:12.99] you don't know that automatically opens
[00:02:09.57 --> 00:02:15.57] up a new Google document
[00:02:12.99 --> 00:02:18.21] your private Google Drive so now that I
[00:02:15.57 --> 00:02:22.02] have paste copied the transcript I'm
[00:02:18.21 --> 00:02:24.03] going to click on edit paste without
[00:02:22.02 --> 00:02:28.31] formatting so that it just plain text
[00:02:24.03 --> 00:02:31.65] and there it is there's the entire video
[00:02:28.31 --> 00:02:33.78] transcript based on you know YouTube's
[00:02:31.65 --> 00:02:36.09] artificial intelligence it's not going
[00:02:33.78 --> 00:02:39.78] to be perfect but it's certainly a great
[00:02:36.09 --> 00:02:43.35] start to editing this into a blog post
[00:02:39.78 --> 00:02:47.00] all right I hope that's helpful and I'll
[00:02:43.35 --> 00:02:47.00] see you in the next video

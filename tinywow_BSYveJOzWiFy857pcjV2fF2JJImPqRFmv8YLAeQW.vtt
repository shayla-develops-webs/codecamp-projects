00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.300
For any YouTube video you can download a

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.270
Written transcript or the subtitles of

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.490
The video. This is especially useful for

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.370
Example if you want to study what

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.400
Someone is saying or you want to edit

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.890
Your own video into a blog post. So let

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.560
Me show you an example using one of my

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.750
Own videos. And here it is — I just

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
Uploaded this video a few hours ago and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.040
The transcript is already available.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.620
It only takes YouTube a few hours to

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.690
Have their artificial intelligence sense

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.780
Into what the person is saying and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.020
Create a transcript. So when you go to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.910
Any YouTube video, scroll down and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.800
Underneath the video — by the way, I'm

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.710
Assuming you are using a laptop or a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.360
Desktop computer — do this: scroll down and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
Then click the three dots underneath the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.670
Video — three dots there — and then click on

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.270
Open transcript. Alright, so here's what

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.270
You do — you're gonna have to, if you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.810
Want to, for example, edit this into a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.700
Blog post, you want to toggle so that the

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.260
Timestamps are no longer there and you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.420
Do this by clicking the three dots here

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.920
Once you've opened the transcript — click

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.540
On the three dots here inside the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.210
Transcript and click on toggle

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.980
Timestamps. Alright, now that the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.240
Timestamps are gone, what I'd like to do

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.610
Is I'd like to scroll down to the very

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.060
Bottom — so quickly scroll down to the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.020
Very bottom, and then once I'm at the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.030
Very bottom — whoops!

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.280
The very bottom — here I click and select

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.700
Going upwards. I find that this is easier

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.260
And has fewer sort of mouse errors if I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.510
Do it from the bottom up instead of from

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.350
The top down. You can experiment yourself

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.590
But anyway, try that and once you have

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.610
Selected it, what you need to do then is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.920
To do Command + C on your keyboard — if

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.590
You're on a Mac — or on Windows it's Ctrl + C

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.770
To copy it to your invisible clipboard.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.570
And then open up a new tab — and what I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.200
Like to do is use Google Docs — so I'm

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.570
Gonna type in doc.new. And in case

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.990
You don't know, that automatically opens

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.570
Up a new Google document

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.210
In your private Google Drive. So now that I

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.020
Have copied the transcript, I'm

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.030
Going to click on Edit → Paste without

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.310
Formatting, so that it's just plain text.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.650
And there it is — there's the entire video

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.780
Transcript, based on YouTube's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
Artificial intelligence. It's not going

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.780
To be perfect, but it's certainly a great

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.350
Start to editing this into a blog post.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.000
Alright, I hope that's helpful and I'll

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.000
See you in the next video.

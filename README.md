# 🌐 My Web Development Journey

Welcome to my project! This repository showcases my progress as I learn web development with the goal of becoming a **Full Stack Developer**.

## 🚀 What This Project Includes

This is a live, multi-page website built using only **HTML,CSS & Javascript**. I have the goals of mastering front-end basics before moving into JavaScript, frameworks like React, and back-end technologies like Node.js and MongoDB.

### Pages:
- [My very first html website 😊](https://shayla-develops-webs.github.io/codecamp-projects/build-a-recipe-page.html)
- [one of my early pages to demonstrate navigation and structure](https://shayla-develops-webs.github.io/codecamp-projects/build-a-travel-agency-page.html)

## 🛠️ Skills I'm Building

- Forms & Tables
- CSS Styling and Layout
- Javascript 
- Functional programming
- localStorage and CRUD
- Responsive Design
- Front end libraries
- Relational databases

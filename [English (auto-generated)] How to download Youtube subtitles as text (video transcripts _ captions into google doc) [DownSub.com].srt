1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,060
for any YouTube video you can download a

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,299
written transcript or the subtitles of

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,269
the video this is especially useful for

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,490
example if you want to study what

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,370
someone is saying or you want to edit

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,400
your own video into a blog post so let

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,890
me show you an example using one of my

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,560
own videos and here it is I just

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,750
uploaded this video a few hours ago and

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,670
the transcript is already available

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,039
it only takes YouTube a few hours to

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,619
have their artificial intelligence sense

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,690
into what the person is saying and

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,780
create a transcript so when you go to

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,020
any youtube video scroll down and

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,910
underneath the video by the way I'm

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,800
assuming you are using a laptop or a

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,710
desktop computer do this scroll down and

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,360
then click the three dots underneath the

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,430
video three dots there and then click on

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,670
open transcript alright so here's what

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,270
you do you're gonna have to it's if you

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,270
want to for example edit this into a

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,809
blog post you want to toggle so that the

25
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,700
timestamps are no longer there and you

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,260
do this by clicking the three dots here

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,420
once you've opened the transcript click

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,920
on the three dots here inside the

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,540
transcript and click on toggle

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,210
timestamps alright now that the

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,979
timestamps are gone what I'd like to do

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,240
is I'd like to scroll down to the very

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,610
bottom so quickly scroll down to the

34
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,060
very bottom and then once I'm at the

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,020
very bottom whoops

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,030
the very bottom here I click and select

37
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,280
going upwards I find that this is easier

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,700
and has fewer sort of Mouse errors if I

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,259
do it from the bottom up instead of from

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,509
the top down you can experiment yourself

41
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,350
but anyway try that and once you have

42
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,590
selected it what you need to do then is

43
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,610
to do command C on your keyboard if

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,920
you're on a Mac or on Windows its ctrl C

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,590
to copy it to your invisible clipboard

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,770
and then open up a new tab and what I

47
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,570
like to do is use Google Docs so I'm

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,200
gonna type in doc dot new and in case

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,569
you don't know that automatically opens

50
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,990
up a new Google document

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,570
your private Google Drive so now that I

52
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,210
have paste copied the transcript I'm

53
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,020
going to click on edit paste without

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,030
formatting so that it just plain text

55
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,310
and there it is there's the entire video

56
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,650
transcript based on you know YouTube's

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,780
artificial intelligence it's not going

58
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,090
to be perfect but it's certainly a great

59
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,780
start to editing this into a blog post

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,350
all right I hope that's helpful and I'll

61
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,000
see you in the next video

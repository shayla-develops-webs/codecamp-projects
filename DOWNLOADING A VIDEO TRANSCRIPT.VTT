for any YouTube video you can download a
0:03
written transcript or the subtitles of
0:06
the video this is especially useful for
0:09
example if you want to study what
0:11
someone is saying or you want to edit
0:14
your own video into a blog post so let
0:17
me show you an example using one of my
0:19
own videos and here it is I just
0:22
uploaded this video a few hours ago and
0:24
the transcript is already available
0:26
it only takes YouTube a few hours to
0:29
have their artificial intelligence sense
0:31
into what the person is saying and
0:33
create a transcript so when you go to
0:36
any youtube video scroll down and
0:39
underneath the video by the way I'm
0:41
assuming you are using a laptop or a
0:43
desktop computer do this scroll down and
Tutorial
0:46
then click the three dots underneath the
0:48
video three dots there and then click on
0:50
open transcript alright so here's what
0:53
you do you're gonna have to it's if you
0:57
want to for example edit this into a
1:00
blog post you want to toggle so that the
1:03
timestamps are no longer there and you
1:05
do this by clicking the three dots here
1:07
once you've opened the transcript click
1:09
on the three dots here inside the
1:10
transcript and click on toggle
1:12
timestamps alright now that the
1:15
timestamps are gone what I'd like to do
1:16
is I'd like to scroll down to the very
1:18
bottom so quickly scroll down to the
1:20
very bottom and then once I'm at the
1:24
very bottom whoops
1:25
the very bottom here I click and select
1:29
going upwards I find that this is easier
1:32
and has fewer sort of Mouse errors if I
1:38
do it from the bottom up instead of from
1:40
the top down you can experiment yourself
1:42
but anyway try that and once you have
1:46
selected it what you need to do then is
1:49
to do command C on your keyboard if
1:53
you're on a Mac or on Windows its ctrl C
1:55
to copy it to your invisible clipboard
1:58
and then open up a new tab and what I
Google Docs
2:01
like to do is use Google Docs so I'm
2:03
gonna type in doc dot new and in case
2:07
you don't know that automatically opens
2:09
up a new Google document
2:12
your private Google Drive so now that I
2:15
have paste copied the transcript I'm
2:18
going to click on edit paste without
2:22
formatting so that it just plain text
2:24
and there it is there's the entire video
2:28
transcript based on you know YouTube's
2:31
artificial intelligence it's not going
2:33
to be perfect but it's certainly a great
2:36
start to editing this into a blog post
2:39
all right I hope that's helpful and I'll
2:43
see you in the next video
